> üìò **This research project was conducted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Data Science.**

---

## üìå Project Objectives

1.  Dataset curation: Develop a comprehensive database of magnetic materials by integrating experimental data sourced from the Materials Project database.
2.  To predict magnetism, magnetic ordering, and ordering temperature by exploring and designing interpretable ML frameworks and increase accuracy.
3.  To explore the important features and subsets that can be used to improve model performance.
4.  To develop a user-friendly prediction web application for more efficiency.
